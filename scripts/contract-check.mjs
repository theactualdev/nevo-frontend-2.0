/**
 * Fail the build when this client and the deployed contract disagree.
 *
 *   node scripts/contract-check.mjs           # exits 1 on any finding
 *   node scripts/contract-check.mjs --warn    # report, always exit 0
 *
 * A GATE, not a report - `api-audit.mjs` is the report and exits 0 by design.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `client.ts` ends in `return (await response.json()) as T`.
 * That is a cast, not a validation, so every hand-written interface in
 * `lib/api` is an assertion the compiler will never check and "TypeScript
 * catches contract drift" is false here by construction. The spec is the only
 * thing that knows the truth, it is published, and it now types 154 of 182
 * operations - so the drift is machine-detectable and simply was not being
 * detected.
 *
 * Two real defects motivate the two checks, and both shipped to users:
 *
 *   REQUEST  the TOSSE form posted `school_name` and `student_count` to an
 *            endpoint whose contract is camelCase, so every booth submission
 *            422'd. A key-level diff finds that in milliseconds.
 *   RESPONSE `POST /join/{token}/accept` returns `loginIdentifier`, and the
 *            client invented its own from the child's name instead - the
 *            server never recognised it, and the child could not sign in.
 *            Nothing on the client could have caught that: the only evidence
 *            was a field in the spec that no client type read.
 *
 * Parsing is done with the TypeScript AST rather than a regex window. The
 * regex version flagged seven call sites and most were false positives, which
 * is how a gate teaches people to ignore it. `typescript` is already a
 * dependency, so this adds nothing to package.json - which matters, because
 * three sessions share this lockfile.
